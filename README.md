# Alzheimer's Disease Detection

This project utilizes machine learning and computer vision techniques to detect Alzheimer's disease from images and live webcam feeds. The model is built using Roboflow's pre-trained model for Alzheimerâ€™s disease detection.

## Features

- **Image Processing**: Detects Alzheimer's-related symptoms in uploaded images.
- **Live Webcam Feed**: Provides real-time predictions from a webcam feed.
- **Bounding Boxes**: Draws bounding boxes on the detected objects in the image or video.
- **Prediction Confidence**: Displays predictions with confidence scores.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple, colorful, and interactive GUI built with **Tkinter**.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Tkinter**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **OpenCV**: For handling image processing and webcam functionality.
- **Roboflow**: Provides the pre-trained model for Alzheimer's disease detection.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For handling images in Tkinter.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the image in a user-friendly format.
